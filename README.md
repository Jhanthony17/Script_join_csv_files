# Script_join_csv_files

This script was proved on Windows 10

The only thing you need to do is change the name of sheets of every excel you have as follow:

-Vulnerabilidades

-Remediadas

After this every excel should have two sheets, Vulnerabilidades and Remediadas. The order doesn't matters.

Then you need to put every excel inside the folder it belongs. There are three folders: Servidores, Estaciones de trabajo and Dispositivos de red.

Thats it, now you need to run the file 'Execute_bash.sh'

Then input the value of variable: fecha_escaneo.

When the script ends the final file will be into the 'Final' folder.
